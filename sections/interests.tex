\cvlistitem{I have a passion for literature and enjoy every bit of it: from reading
books to writing and translating. I have played the piano for 15 years and I have also
used technology to teach myself to play the guitar, which I now consider my first
instrument. I feel that music and especially playing these instruments allows me to both
relax and disconnect from my daily routine. I also love doing sports, like cycling and
football, going to the cinema and watching a good TV series. One of my passions is
travelling, which I would like to experience more and more with my family, friends, and
to meet new people in every place.}
