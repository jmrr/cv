% short description of thesis
Awarded `A' mark. The project was accomplished in collaboration with medical image processing company Medicsight and NHS expert colonoscopists.This thesis applied image processing and computer vision techniques to endoscopic images, with the purpose of improving the characterisation and classification of large bowel polyps in real-time during colonoscopy.
% evaluation
I improved the classification accuracy on two datasets by a 2 and 5\% respectively (up to 86.44\% and 94.64\%) by adding four new features to the existing five.
I also designed and implemented different approaches to narrow the margin of classification error by producing measurements of feature stability such as feature variability across the surface of polyps.
