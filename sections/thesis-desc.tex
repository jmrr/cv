% short description of thesis
My thesis work is focused on the development of Computer Vision and Signal Processing algorithms to help the blind and partially sighted people to navigate.
I am currently designing vision models that extract distinctive information from mobile phone video sequences to describe paths. I am also exploring ways of fusing smartphone sensor information to provide indoor location. Additionally, I have been part of a team that has built a database of grocery products for object recognition taking into account the particularities of the objects being hand held and the images acquired by sighted or blind users.
% evaluation
%I've improved evaluation by carefully varying the relationship between the training and testing data to better estimate real-world benefits.
%I also designed and implemented a user study, which validated the correlation between keystroke savings (a simulated evaluation) and user testing.
