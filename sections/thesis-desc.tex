% short description of thesis
My thesis work focused on the development of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition algorithms for appearance-based visual localization. Particularly, my main interest was in biologically inspired methods that could also work in other fields such as object recognition. My research also involved extensive use of Machine Learning algorithms both for supervised and unsupervised learning (e.g. neural networks, SVMs, multivariate regression, LDA, clustering methods, etc.).

Additionally, I have extensive experience in developing benchmarks for appearance-based methods. I have contributed the benchmark pipeline code and novel datasets for hand-held object recognition (\url{http://short.bicv.org}) and visual localization from wearable cameras (\url{http://rsm.bicv.org}).

% evaluation
%I've improved evaluation by carefully varying the relationship between the training and testing data to better estimate real-world benefits.
%I also designed and implemented a user study, which validated the correlation between keystroke savings (a simulated evaluation) and user testing.
