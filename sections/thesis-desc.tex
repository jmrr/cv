% short description of thesis
My thesis work is focused on the development of Computer Vision and Signal Processing algorithms for visual localisation and navigation. One of my motivations is to help the blind and partially sighted people to navigate.

I am currently designing vision models that extract distinctive information from mobile/wearable cameras video sequences to describe paths. In particular, I study ways of exploiting the spatio-temporal information from the sequences to provide indoor location. 

Additionally, I have led a team that has built a database of grocery products for object recognition taking into account the particularities of the objects being hand held and the images acquired by sighted or blind users.
% evaluation
%I've improved evaluation by carefully varying the relationship between the training and testing data to better estimate real-world benefits.
%I also designed and implemented a user study, which validated the correlation between keystroke savings (a simulated evaluation) and user testing.
