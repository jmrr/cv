% short description of thesis
My thesis work improves language modeling and evaluation for word prediction, specifically to increase typing speed with motor impairments.
I've designed language models that adapt to the topic and style of the user's language and also addressed issues in sparseness.
% evaluation
I've improved evaluation by carefully varying the relationship between the training and testing data to better estimate real-world benefits.
I also designed and implemented a user study, which validated the correlation between keystroke savings (a simulated evaluation) and user testing.
