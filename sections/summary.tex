I am a Data Science professional that can deliver solid engineering solutions across many areas of the Data and AI spectrum. I can work as a Data Scientist, Data Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer, but more importantly, I bring experience from each of these disciplines to be able to accomplish end-to-end Data Science solutions. From developing Machine Learning algorithms to creating complex, Big Data-ready ETL pipelines to deploying Machine Learning as a Service, I can take a project from idea to API and deploy this to the cloud.
