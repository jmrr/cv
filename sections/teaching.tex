\subsection{Teaching assistant -- study groups}
\cventry{2011 -- 2012}{Signals and Systems}{BE2-HSAS}{}{}{Students learn how to approach and solve signal processing problems. I led 3 study groups of 20 students each. Prepared and presented the background and material for each problem, encouraged the students to solve them and choose the best approach. I helped maintain student interest by providing a detailed step by step explanation of the problems.}

%\cventry{Spring 2011}{Data Structures}{CISC 220}{}{}{Students learn to implement data structures and algorithms in C++ with a strong focus on computational complexity.
%So far, it has been an experience in adapting lessons learned in summer and winter sessions to the main session.
%The content refines the previous focus on benchmarking.

%\cventry{Summer 2010}{Data Structures}{CISC 220}{}{}{Students learn to implement data structures and algorithms in C++ with a strong focus on computational complexity.
%My curriculum added benchmarking as a recurring theme to support and contrast theoretical analysis.

%\cventry{Summer 2008}{Introduction to Computer Science II}{CISC 181}{}{}{CISC 181 covers object-oriented programming and software design with C++ for students with a semester or equivalent of programming experience.
%I helped balance practicality and maintain student interest with two new projects:  a blackjack program with several AI settings and a spam filter which loaded emails in mbox format.

%% Terry gave me all As ``Keith did a lot of work with procmail for me --- a big help.''
%% a few comments: ``good TA, nice guy'' ``good job Keith''

%% helped re-write the lab manual (lots of errors)
%% no summary sheet for reviews, but Zhu gave me 'A' in all categories ``Keith can become a great teacher with all the dedication he gives to the students.''
