\cventry{October 2011 -- Present}{PhD researcher}{Imperial College London}{PI: Dr Anil A. Bharath}{}{I am currently designing core algorithms for visual localization based on crowdsourced paths. In particular I have proposed a biologically inspired method that uses neural networks to improve the recall of already visited places. I have also built and benchmarked two novel datasets:
\begin{itemize}
\item  The RSM dataset of ``visual paths'' for benchmarking visual localisation algorithms. It contains more than 1.8 km of video sequences captured with mobile and wearable devices along 6 indoor locations.
\item A house-hold products dataset (the SHORT-100 dataset). SHORT-100 contains more than 150,000 images capturing usage particularities of blind and partially sighted people.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{October 2008 -- February 2010}{Research Assistant}{The Minerva Project: Vodafone Spain, regional Government and University of Seville R\&D project}{PI: Dr Alejandro Carballar}{}{This initiative funded my final year project. I researched on the IMS protocols and worked on R\&D project monitoring and management. I was able to work in a multidisciplinary environment, studying the applications of my main research topic in other areas of interest such as Bioengineering or Social Services.
