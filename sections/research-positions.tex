\section{Research Positions}
\cventry{October 2011--Present}{PhD student}{Imperial College London}{Dr. Anil A. Bharath}{}{I am currently designing core algorithms for visual navigation and sensor data fusion. I have also built and benchmarked a house-hold products dataset (the SHORT-30 dataset). SHORT-30 contains more than 100,000 images capturing usage particularities of blind and partially sighted people. Another ongoing project is based on the integration of smartphone sensory information to provide indoor localisation relying on crowdsourced paths.

\cventry{October 2008--February 2010}{Research Assistant}{The Minerva Project: Vodafone Spain, regional Government and University of Seville R\&D project}{Dr. Alejandro Carballar}{}{This initiative funded my final year project. I researched on the IMS protocols and worked on R\&D project monitoring and management. I was able to work in a multidisciplinary environment, studying the applications of my main research topic in other areas of interest such as Bioengineering or Social Services.
