\section{Experience}

%------------------------------------------------

\cventry{2014}{Summer Intern}{\textsc{The MathWorks}}{Cambridge, UK}{}{Development/Application Engineering team. Developed MATLAB and Simulink models that interface with a variety of sensors and actuators connected to target hardware (Arduino and Raspberry Pi) using I2C as communication protocol and automatic C code generation for deployment on target hardware:
\begin{itemize}
\item Contributed the C code to interface the I2C Linux kernel tools allowing for code generation and deployed use on Raspberry Pis.
\item Added MATLAB and Simulink support to 6 different sensors and actuators.
\item Developed MATLAB OOP classes and examples for individual sensor/actuator operation.
\item Created Simulink sensor and actuator integration models: 10-DOF inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor fusion model with 3D visualization, pan and tilt unit using microservos.
\item Developed prototypes of hardware camera stabilisation using microservos and IMU readings, and object tracking camera using object tracking algorithms and I2C microservos.
\end{itemize}
I also expanded two current examples from the Computer Vision toolbox providing a more robust object tracking technique and adding face tracking to the face recognition demo.
