\section{Advising Experience}
\subsection{Stephen Steward (co-advised with Kathleen F. McCoy)}
\cvline{}{Started a project to utilize a gaming input device for an assistive typing system.  
We used OCZ Technologies' Neural Impulse Actuator, which controls PC games using EEG signals.
Specifically, we used the NIA to navigate a typing interface in response to left/right eye movement and facial muscle tension.
